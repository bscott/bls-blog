Modern websites have become increasingly complex. The average webpage now weighs several megabytes, loads dozens of scripts, and tracks every interaction. This blog takes a different approach.

## The Problem with Modern Web Design

Many modern sites suffer from:

- **Excessive JavaScript** - Frameworks that ship megabytes of code for simple interactions
- **Design trends** - Following the latest aesthetic rather than prioritizing usability
- **Tracking and analytics** - Privacy-invasive scripts that slow down page loads
- **Over-engineering** - Complex build pipelines for what should be simple HTML

## The Retro Alternative

The early web got a lot of things right:

- HTML that loads instantly
- Clear, accessible design
- Focus on content over decoration
- Respect for users' bandwidth and privacy

This blog embraces those principles while using modern tools like Astro to maintain good developer experience.

## Finding Balance

Retro web design doesn't mean rejecting all modern improvements. It means:

- Using JavaScript only when necessary
- Choosing semantic HTML over div soup
- Prioritizing accessibility and performance
- Respecting users' time and attention

The result is a site that loads instantly, works everywhere, and focuses on what matters: the content.
