Welcome to my blog! This is the first post on this new platform, and I wanted to take a moment to explain what this blog is about and why it looks the way it does.

## The Philosophy

This blog embraces a **retro-web aesthetic** that prioritizes:

- Simplicity over complexity
- Function over form
- Readability over decoration
- Performance over features

The design is intentionally minimal, drawing inspiration from the early 2000s web when sites were fast, accessible, and focused on content rather than flashy visuals.

## The Design

You'll notice a few distinctive elements:

### ASCII Bracket Navigation

The navigation uses ASCII brackets like `[home]` and `[blog]`, giving the site a terminal-like feel. This is both nostalgic and functional.

### Classic Link Colors

Links are the classic blue (#0000ff) when unvisited and purple (#551a8b) when visited. No fancy hover effects, just good old-fashioned hyperlinks.

### System Fonts

The site uses system fonts, which means:
- Zero font downloads
- Instant rendering
- Native feel on every platform
- Better performance

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- Web development and programming
- System design and architecture
- Tools and workflows
- Whatever else interests me

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you enjoy the content!
